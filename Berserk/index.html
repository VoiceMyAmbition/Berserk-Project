<h2 class="subtitle" id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Berserk (Japanese: ベルセルク, Hepburn: Beruseruku) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by 
    Kentaro Miura. Set in a medieval Europe-inspired dark fantasy world, the story centers on the characters 
    of Guts, a lone mercenary, and Griffith, the leader of a mercenary band called the "Band of the Hawk".
</p>

<h2 class="subtitle" id="plot">Plot</h2>
<p >Guts (ガッツ, Gattsu) is a wandering mercenary who has known war and death since he was born from a hanged corpse and saved by his adopted 
    mother, who died from the plague when he was only three years old. He was raised and trained as a mercenary by his adopted father, Gambino,
     but Gambino blamed Guts for his wife's death, selling access to the boy to a rapist amongst the mercenaries and later, attempts to murder 
     Guts in a drunken rage. Guts flees after killing his adoptive father in self-defense, eventually growing into a young mercenary who earned 
     a fearsome reputation while fighting. Guts eventually catches the attention of Griffith, the angelically charismatic leader of the mercenary 
     group, "Band of the Hawk" (鷹の団, Taka no Dan). Griffith forces Guts into joining his forces upon defeating him in battle. Guts quickly rises 
     through the ranks of the mercenary group, eventually becoming the Hawks' renowned raid leader and Griffith's deadliest subordinate. They are 
     hired by the kingdom of Midland to help win the Hundred Year War against the Tudor empire. During this time, Guts bonds with the Band of
      the Hawk and learns of Griffith's mysterious pendant, the Crimson Behelit, along with Griffith's dream to rule a kingdom of his own. When
       the Hawks encounter a monstrous immortal being known as Nosferatu Zodd, it adds further mystery to the Behelit as Zodd spares Guts and 
       Griffith upon seeing it, warning the former of his impending death should he be a true friend of Griffith's.
</p><p>
    In time, the Hawks play a vital role in ending Midland's Hundred Year War with the nation of Tudor, eventually becoming ordained knights by
     the king of Midland. Guts gradually develops a relationship with Griffith's unit commander, Casca, the Hawks' only female member. Casca 
     and Guts are initially hostile toward one another, but eventually start to fall in love after Guts saves Casca's life and successfully 
     fights against one hundred men by himself to save her. After having overheard Griffith say that he can only consider someone a true friend
      if they have their own dream, Guts tries to leave the Hawks as the war ends and Griffith defeats his political enemies. Griffith refuses 
      to let Guts leave the Band of the Hawk, claiming that he owns him. The two duel in single combat and Guts wins in a single blow. Unable
       to cope with losing to Guts, Griffith ruins his fortunes when found seducing the King's daughter, Charlotte. He ends up imprisoned to
        be tortured endlessly while the Hawks are marked for death. During Griffith's captivity, his torturer throws his behelit away. Guts 
        spends the next year of his life training to become a better swordsman, but is warned on his first night by a mysterious, seemingly 
        demonic being he calls "The Skull Knight", that his actions have set forth "The Eclipse", that will happen in one year's time. After
         hearing of the Hawks' dire straights in a fighting tournament, he temporarily returns to the Hawks and learns of Griffith's fate and
          the rest of the story. He reunites and starts a romantic relationship with Casca and helps the outlawed remnants of the Hawks rescue
           Griffith, only to find him horribly mutilated and rendered a mute shadow of his former self.
</p><p>
    Though the group successfully escapes past the border with Griffith, it becomes clear that Griffith's injuries are too great and he would 
    never again be able to physically move on his own or fulfill his dream of ruling a kingdom. Guts also soon plans to leave the Hawks again,
     bringing Casca with him, though she refuses to go, overwhelmed by guilt over Griffith's current state. Through preordained events, the 
     despairing Griffith regains his behelit and unknowingly activates it during a solar eclipse. This transports the Hawks to another plane 
     where they encounter archdemons collectively known as the God Hand in a ceremony known as "the Eclipse". Urged onward by the eldritch
      beings to become one of them to realize his dream, Griffith sacrifices his soldiers to the God Hand's "apostles"—humans like Nosferatu 
      Zodd who have become powerful demons by sacrificing their loved ones and humanity for power—each of the Hawks are "branded" with a symbol
      on their body identifying them as sacrifices. While Griffith has visions from the God Hand showing him that he was always destined to 
      come to the Eclipse, Guts and Casca desperately fight for their lives while witnessing the brutal slaughter of their comrades. Eventually
       all of the Band of the Hawk are slaughtered and devoured by the demons. However, with Casca being the only woman present, she is toyed
        with naked by the demons. Griffith finally emerges reborn as the God Hand's fifth and final member, "Femto". Griffith's first act upon
         his ascension is to rape Casca in front of Guts. Guts loses his right eye and cuts off his own left forearm to escape captivity in a
          rage-filled attempt to kill Griffith and save Casca before losing consciousness.
</p><p>
    Guts and Casca are saved from death and brought back into the physical world at the last minute through the intervention of the mysterious
    and powerful Skull Knight yet again. However, the damage is done, as Casca is rendered insane from her horrific experiences. Guts learns
     that the Brands of Sacrifice that he and Casca now bear leave him open to be preyed upon by specters and other evil supernatural creatures
      on a nightly basis. Casca is left in the care of the blacksmith Godo and Rickert, the only Band of the Hawk member who escaped sacrifice 
      because he was not present at the Crimson Behelit's activation. Guts takes an enormous sword from Godo known as Dragonslayer, and a 
      prosthetic left arm that contains a hidden cannon built by Rickert, and begins hunting down apostles in search of revenge against Griffith.
       During this time, Guts begins seeing an ethereal deformed infant that appears before him, what was his and Casca's unborn child tainted
        by Femto's rape.
</p><p>
    Two years later, Guts is joined by an elf named Puck and a young thief named Isidro. Casca eventually runs away from Rickert, sending Guts
     on a mad hunt to find her. Guts is later reunited with Casca as she is about to be burned as a witch in the city of St. Albion. There, 
     along with Puck and Isidro, they encounter Farnese and Serpico of the Holy See Church's Holy Iron Chain Knights. Guts endures a nightmarish 
     ordeal that ends in Griffith being incarnated into a new physical form being restored through a misshapen Apostle whose dream was to "hatch"
      a new world. This Apostle also ingested the deformed infant after stumbling upon its weakened and dying body moments before the Incarnation
       ceremony, resulting in Griffith's new body bearing some sort of influence of the infant.
</p><p>
    Puck suggests that Casca's mind might be restored if they take her to the Elven realm of Elfhel. Guts, desperate to save his loved one, heads
     there for sanctuary with the help of his new companions. They are soon joined by the witch Schierke who teaches Farnese magic and negates 
     the effects of the brand on Guts and Casca. Griffith creates a second Band of the Hawk with Zodd and other demonic Apostles among its ranks
      to battle the invading Kushan army. The war between Griffith and the Kushan emperor, Ganishka, a rogue apostle, climaxes with the emperor's
       destruction and the overlapping of the mortal realm and the supernatural astral realm.
</p><p>
    Now unopposed, Griffith finally obtains his own kingdom by establishing his rule over Midland with the endorsement of the Pope and Princess 
    Charlotte, creating the city of Falconia to provide the Midlanders with refuge from the ever-increasing attacks of mythical beasts, unaware
     that their new ruler is actually one of them. At the same time, Guts and his party take a ship toward Elfhelm. Following a dramatic battle
      with the Sea God, Guts's party reaches Elfhelm, on the island of Skellig. The elf ruler, Danann, helps Farnese and Schierke travel into
       Casca's mind and restore her to her former self. However, despite recovering her memories, Casca still has not overcome the trauma from 
       the events of the eclipse completely, usually collapsing when she sees Guts or remembers her fallen comrades. At the same time, Farnese
        and Schierke begin training with the other apprentice witches and wizards living on Skellig, during which Farnese expresses an interest
         in the power to heal human souls, specifically Casca. At the same time, Guts encounters the Skull Knight once again who tells him that
          his journey is at an end.
</p><p>
    Meanwhile, Griffith is shown leading his new armies of both humans and "war demons" against an army of giants that have emerged due to the 
    effects of Griffith's and Ganishka's war. Griffith's army scores a swift victory with Griffith delivering the final blow against the giant 
    leader in the climax of the battle. Following this, Griffith participates in a council with the other nobles of Falconia before departing 
    that evening for currently unknown reasons.
